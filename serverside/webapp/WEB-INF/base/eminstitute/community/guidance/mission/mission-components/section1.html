<h2>Why We Dance</h2>
<p>Life is a series of movements—some fluid, some challenging. Just like in dance, we face moments of hesitation, imbalance, and uncertainty. But with the right guidance, every step, every turn, and every leap can bring us closer to a more fulfilled and confident self.</p>
<p class="mb-0">At GuiDance, we use the rhythm of dance as a metaphor for life. Through structured lessons infused with mindfulness, emotional intelligence, and self-reflection, we help you:</p>
