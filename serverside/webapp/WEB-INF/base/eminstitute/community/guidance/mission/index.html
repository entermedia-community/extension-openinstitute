    <p>At GuiDance, we believe that movement is more than just an art—it’s a powerful tool for transformation. Our mission is to guide individuals on a journey of self-discovery, confidence, and personal growth by merging the expressive power of dance with the life-changing insights of coaching.</p>
    <h2>Why We Dance</h2>
    <p>Life is a series of movements—some fluid, some challenging. Just like in dance, we face moments of hesitation, imbalance, and uncertainty. But with the right guidance, every step, every turn, and every leap can bring us closer to a more fulfilled and confident self.</p>
    <p class="mb-0">At GuiDance, we use the rhythm of dance as a metaphor for life. Through structured lessons infused with mindfulness, emotional intelligence, and self-reflection, we help you:</p>
