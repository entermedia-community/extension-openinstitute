    <h3>How do you measure the success of a campaign?</h3>

      <p>
        We use key performance indicators (KPIs) such as

        return on ad spend (ROAS), and brand awareness metrics to
        track and evaluate the effectiveness of each campaign.

      What is the typical timeline for a marketing campaign?
    </h3>
    <div class="faq-content">
      <p>
        The timeline varies based on the campaign type and
        objectives. A social media campaign may take a few weeks
        to launch, while a full-scale brand campaign may require
        months of planning and execution. We provide a clear
        timeline during the strategy phase.
